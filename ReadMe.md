# useDebounce Hook

A lightweight and reusable React hook for debouncing function calls. It waits until a user stops triggering an event (e.g., typing) for a specified delay before executing the provided function ‚Äî perfect for optimizing input handling, search boxes, and API requests.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install react-debounce
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-debounce

## üîß Usage

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useDebounce } from "react-debounce";

const SearchInput = () => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");

  const debouncedSearch = useDebounce((value: string) => {
    // Your API call or logic here
    console.log("Searching for:", value);
  }, 500);

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setQuery(e.target.value);
    debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input value={query} onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Search..." />
  );
};
